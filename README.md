# Northwind

Sample application using the well known Northwind database.

Features are added as examples to use in real world projects, more will be added over time but so far they include:

1. CQRS pattern
2. Simple to follow (very simple!) login authorisation that is covered in another pinned project (with accompanying blogpost).
3. Custom tag helpers for providing HTML5 validation (i.e. JavaScript free!).
4. Barely any JavaScript at all.
5. Picnic css library for simplicity (hopefully divitus free HTML markup).
